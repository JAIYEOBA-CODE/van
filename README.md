# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Installation
The best way to consume React-Bootstrap is via the npm package which you can install with npm (or yarn if you prefer).

If you plan on customizing the Bootstrap Sass files, or don't want to use a CDN for the stylesheet, it may be helpful to install vanilla Bootstrap as well.

npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
